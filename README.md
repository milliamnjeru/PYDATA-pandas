 -I worked on basic overview of pandas and got to understand some of the terms that used :
 
 - I had to  pip install pandas ,them import pandas as pd .
   
  -The data required me to do some of the terms like filtering and sorting,grouping,data indexing and selection,handling missingness of data,merging and joining using various ways like pivot tables.
  
 - I also worked on mathematical concept that is time series  that dealt with string data also and had an experience with mathematical concept.
   

  General breakdown of my work is as follows:
  
  - Foundations to pandas  as week1 dealt with pokeman data.
    
  -Data manipulation:
  
     - filtering and sorting (Euro12 data)
     
     - grouping(Occupation data)
     
  -Data analysis:
  
   - apply(Us_Crime_Rate data)

  -Advanced pandas analysis:
  
   - getting to knowing your data (food data)
